# Stamp Album

This is a basic web app to organize and store your stamps. The UI is slightly large because I've created this app for my french grandfather, who has some eye-related issues. I deployed this app using Vercel: https://stamp-album.vercel.app/. Stamps are saved in the LocalStorage because I didn't want to create a complicated app; I wanted one that would help my grandfather store his stamps since he struggles with apps like LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets.

# Search a Stamp
You are able to search for a stamp by its NWT number or its name.
You can also choose to display only your duplicate stamps.

# Edit a Stamp
To edit, click on the table where the stamp you want to edit is located.
You can delete a stamp. There are also copy buttons in the edit modal to facilitate my grandfather.
